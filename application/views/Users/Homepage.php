                    <p>Most of the important processes in the institutes are carried out manually such as the registration
                  of the students, managing huge information about students, faculty members i.e. the teaching and
                  non-teaching staff, managing documents for different entities which leads to enormous bulk of
                  work. This results in poor efficiency, lots of documentation which again leads to unmanage- able
                  data, tedious process and requires a lot of time and human resource
                  . The main goal of the Exam Cell Automation System is to minimize these workloads and make
                  the Exam Cell process much more convenient to follow. The Exam Cell processes include the
                  managing of studentâ€™s academic status distinguished by the year, the departments, the classes as
                  well as with respect to subjects. The Exam Cell process also includes the generation of hall
                  tickets, the generation of exam forms along with the k.t. forms, the generation of results, the
                  generation of gazette copies etc. These all processes are carried out either manually or with the
                  help of some third party software. The use of multiple software for carrying out a process is
                  never considered efficient.</p>
